This site was created as a result of a couple things.  First I got a new job as the Product Architect at my company ([BI Worldwide][biw]) in October 2015.  Part of this job's responsibility was to evaluate our tech stack and research additions or changes to that stack that would help us deliver better products, iterate on our application more quickly and ultimately support the business goals of becoming more nimble and industry leading.

The second thing that contributed to this site was an meetup that I attended just a few weeks after receiving that promotion.  I hadn't really attended many meetups before this one (alright, just one other one) but it was specifically about tech stacks so I thought it would be perfect.  I was only able to go to the first 90 minutes of the meeting but I figured that would be plenty to get me some good ideas and maybe make some connections to further the discussion.  The first 30 minutes were spent eating pizza and trying to figure out Google Hangouts but then we got into the discussion.  I would've liked less boilerplate discussion about what a tech stack is but that much aside the 60 minutes of actual content went pretty much how I'd hoped.

After that evening and the discussions that were had there it became clear there is no good formula for this and no clear answer.  I also struggled to find a place where lots of people were openly discussion their tech stacks.  There are lots of blog posts about this new stack or that new approach but little (that I could find) in terms of real people just listing off what they're doing and why.  So that's what this is meant to be.  Informal and friendly discussion about what people are doing, why they're doing it and what else they've considered.  Maybe it'll change and evolve from there but right now it just needs to be a place to post some samples and explanations all in one place.
