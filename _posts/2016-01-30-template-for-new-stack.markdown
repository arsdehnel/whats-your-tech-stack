This is the template for contributors to use as a starting point.  Please clone this git repo (see footer for repo details), copy this file, rename it to the appropriate date and name of your company/team/project that you're contributing thoughts on a stack for.  Then create a pull request and I'll review it and get it added to the site.

## What's your tech stack?

## What other options did you consider?

## What predetermined conditions did this decision have to work within?

## What factors made you make the choice that you made?

## Where do you hope to expand, change or evolve your tech stack in the future?
